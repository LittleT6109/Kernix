# Discord Server Code of Conduct

## Purpose and Scope

This server exists to provide a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all members. Our goal is to foster healthy discussion, collaboration, and community without harassment, discrimination, or unnecessary conflict.

This Code of Conduct applies to **all members**, including moderators and administrators, across **all server channels, voice chats, direct interactions related to the server, and any connected platforms** where behavior may impact the community.

By participating in this server, you agree to follow the rules outlined below.

---

## 1. Discrimination, Harassment, and Hate Speech

Discrimination, harassment, or hate speech of any kind is strictly prohibited.

This includes, but is not limited to, behavior or language targeting individuals or groups based on:
- Race or ethnicity
- Nationality or immigration status
- Gender or gender identity
- Sexual orientation
- Religion or belief system
- Disability or medical condition
- Age or appearance

Slurs, demeaning language, stereotypes, coded language, or “jokes” targeting protected groups are not allowed, regardless of intent. Claiming something was meant as humor does not exempt it from moderation.

Repeated unwanted contact, intimidation, threats, or attempts to make others feel unsafe or unwelcome will result in immediate action.

---

## 2. Respectful Behavior and Community Conduct

All members are expected to treat one another with basic respect and decency.

The following behaviors are not permitted:
- Personal attacks, insults, or name-calling
- Harassment or persistent antagonizing
- Threats, coercion, or intimidation
- Deliberately provoking others to start arguments
- Dismissive or hostile behavior toward new members

Disagreements are allowed, but they must remain civil and constructive. Attack ideas, not people.

If another member asks you to stop a behavior that affects them, you are expected to respect that boundary.

---

## 3. Language and Communication Policy

English is the primary language of this server to ensure accessibility and effective moderation. If you need to communicate in another language, please move the conversation to direct messages.

Moderate use of profanity is allowed. However:
- Profanity may not be directed at another person without clear mutual consent
- Profanity may not be used in a threatening, demeaning, or aggressive manner
- Excessive or disruptive language may be moderated at staff discretion

Spam, excessive pinging, message flooding, or intentionally derailing conversations is prohibited.

---

## 4. Arguments, Conflict, and Drama

Public arguments, callouts, or prolonged disputes are discouraged.

If a conversation becomes heated, hostile, or disruptive, moderators may:
- Ask participants to de-escalate
- Require the discussion to move to direct messages
- Issue warnings or further action if necessary

Dogpiling, brigading, or encouraging others to target or harass a specific individual will result in immediate moderation action.

If you have an issue with another member, attempt to resolve it privately or contact the moderation team for assistance.

---

## 5. Compliance with Discord Terms of Service

All members must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines at all times.

Content or behavior that violates Discord policy—including but not limited to:
- Illegal content or activity
- Threats of violence or self-harm
- Exploitation or abuse
- Distribution of malicious software

will result in immediate action and may be reported to Discord Trust & Safety without warning.

---

## 6. Exploits, Loopholes, and Bad-Faith Behavior

Attempting to bypass rules, exploit loopholes, or act in bad faith to avoid moderation is prohibited.

This includes:
- Intentionally skirting the wording of rules to justify harmful behavior
- Encouraging others to break rules indirectly
- Sharing methods to evade moderation or enforcement
- Abusing moderation gaps or technical limitations

If you discover a loophole, bug, or policy issue, report it to staff instead of exploiting it.

---

## 7. Moderation Authority and Enforcement

Moderators and administrators are responsible for maintaining the safety and health of the community.

Staff reserve the right to take action on behavior not explicitly listed in this document if it is deemed harmful or disruptive to the server.

Possible actions include, but are not limited to:
- Verbal or written warnings
- Temporary mutes or restrictions
- Kicks from the server
- Permanent bans

Publicly arguing with moderation decisions is not allowed. If you believe a mistake was made, contact the staff team respectfully through appropriate channels.

---

## 8. Rule Updates and Amendments

This Code of Conduct may be updated or modified at any time.

Members are responsible for staying informed of the current rules. Continued participation in the server constitutes acceptance of any changes.

---

## Final Note

These rules exist to protect the community, not to restrict it. If you are unsure whether something is allowed, err on the side of caution or ask a moderator.

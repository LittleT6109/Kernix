# Kernix

Kernix is an open-source Discord bot built to be improved, and used by the community.

## Contributing

Adding/modifying code is welcome, and even requested! I aim to have a community-built bot packed full of features for everyone to enjoy.

There are some restrictions though:
- Malicious code intended to harm users/guilds
- Code that invades the privacy of others
- Code that ruins the user's experience in general

### Per-Guild

Kernix supports per-guild cogs. You can make your commands and make a pull request, or ask me to make them for you. Either way, you can have custom commands in your server!

## Features

Almost everything is optional. Here is a list of all features:
- Leveling/XP system
- Many kinds of logging: Edits/Deletes, Nickname changes, Username changes, Invite creation, Joining/Leaving
- Custom welcome messages
- Autorole
- Moderation commands soon to come!
